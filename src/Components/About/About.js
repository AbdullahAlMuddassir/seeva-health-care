                            Many future gene and cell therapies to treat diseases like cancer, rare genetic and other conditions could be enhanced in their efficacy, persistence, and predictability by so-called "genomic safe harbors (GSHs)." These are landing sites in the human genome able to safely accommodate new therapeutic genes without causing other, unintended changes in a cell's genome that could pose a risk to patients.However, finding GSHs with potential for clinical translation has been as difficult as finding a lunar landing site for a spacecraft -; which hasbe in smooth and approachable territory, not too steep and surrounded by large hills or cliffs, providevisibility, and enable a safe return. A GSH, similarly, needs to be accessible by genome editing technologies, freephysical obstacles like genes and other functional sequences, and allow high, stable,expression of a "landed" therapeutic gene.
